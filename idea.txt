Idea: 

I'm trying to create an automated summarizer that would scan through all relevant resources online and generate a digestable report (can be as detailed or as high level as configurable).
It should read relevant sources of online information, first summarize what those are and then do cross linking on what the different events mean - as in read between the lines, do a best effort guess (not necessarily predict)
be able to tentatively put out potential opinions that might happen in the next few days based on the sources
