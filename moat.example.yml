# .moat.yml — Per-project configuration for Moat
# Place this file in your workspace root (the directory you pass to `moat`)
#
# All sections are optional. If no .moat.yml exists, Moat uses defaults.

# Background services — Docker containers on the sandbox network
# These run alongside the devcontainer and are accessible by service name.
# Smart defaults (healthcheck, resource limits) are applied for known images:
#   postgres, redis, mysql, mariadb, mongo
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    env:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: moat
      POSTGRES_DB: dev
  redis:
    image: redis:7

# Environment variables — injected into the devcontainer
# Use these to configure your app to connect to the services above.
env:
  DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:moat@postgres:5432/dev
  REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379

# Extra allowed domains — added to the squid proxy whitelist
# Use leading dot to match domain + all subdomains (e.g., .crates.io matches crates.io and *.crates.io)
# Base domains (github, npm, anthropic, pypi, golang, etc.) are always allowed.
domains:
  - .crates.io
  - .docker.io
  - .rubygems.org
