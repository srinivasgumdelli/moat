# Anvil — Claude Code Instructions

## Workflow
- Always commit and push changes without asking.
- Use smaller, logically grouped commits.
- Use `bd` (beads) for task tracking. Run `bd init` if `.beads/` doesn't exist. Create tasks with `bd add`, update status with `bd set`, and check tasks with `bd list`.
