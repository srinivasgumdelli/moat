# Next Steps

## IDE Features (Phase 4) — Remaining

Items 1-3 are done. What's left from `docs/ideas.md`:

1. **Per-project config** — `.claude/ide.yml` to configure language servers, services, and allowed domains per project.
2. **Web preview / screenshots** — Playwright MCP for frontend work.
3. **Background services** — Extend docker-compose for postgres, redis, etc.
4. **Debugging tools** — Print debugging on steroids, snapshot debugging, etc.
5. **Project indexing** — ctags, dependency graphs, architecture summaries for large codebases.

See `docs/ideas.md` for full details.
